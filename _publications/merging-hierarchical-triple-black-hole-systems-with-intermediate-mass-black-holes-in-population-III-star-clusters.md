In this work, we investigate hierarchical triple black hole systems containing intermediate-mass black holes with merging inner binaries, focusing on their population properties, such as mass, orbital eccentricity, and merger rates, within Population III clusters. Additionally, we explore the future detection prospects of instruments like LISA, TianQin, Taiji, CE, ET, LIGO, KAGRA, and DECIGO for these inner merging binary black holes. We also discuss the potential scientific implications, particularly in constraining their formation channels through the measurement of their orbital eccentricities.
