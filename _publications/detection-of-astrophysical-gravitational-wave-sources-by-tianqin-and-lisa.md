In this work, we investigate the detection prospects of TianQin, LISA, as well as the network of them, for massive black hole binaries, stellar-mass black hole binaries, double white dwarfs, extreme mass ratio inspirals, light and heavy intermediate mass ratio inspirals, as well as the stochastic gravitational background of astrophysical origin. For each of these sources, we analyze how far they can be detected (detection distance) and how well their parameters can be measured (detection accuracy) using a Fisher Matrix analysis.
