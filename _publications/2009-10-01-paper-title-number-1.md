In this work, we investigate hierarchical triple black hole systems with intermediate-mass black holes having merging inner binaries, especially their population properties, e.g., mass, orbital eccentricity and merger rate, in population III clusters. Furthermore, we also study the future detection prospect of LISA/TianQin/Taiji/CE/ET/LIGO/KAGRA/DECIGO for their inner merging binary black holes, as well as potential scienfice implication, i.e., constraining their formation channels by measuring their orbital eccentricity.
