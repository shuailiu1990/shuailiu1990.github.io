In this work, we examine the future prospects of LISA and TianQin for detecting GW190521-like binary black holes, where the primary components fall within the upper mass gap. This includes estimating the detection rates and the precision of source parameter measurements. Additionally, we explore the potential to constrain the Hubble constant by treating these systems as dark sirens.
